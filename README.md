# blank-static-html
A blank HTML and CSS project to start your prototypes or other projects with.
I've kept this very minimal so you can always make it your own. I would appreciate it if you do use this, that you mention me and/or this project.

## How it's made
This simple template is made for basic projects. For example, a prototype or people who want to learn how to code.
